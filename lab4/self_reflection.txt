All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:
Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The staff solution used a more efficient resizing approach, where the resize only happens when necessary and at the right time. This made the resizing logic cleaner and more efficient compared to my implementation.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: My code effectively meets all requirements of the ArrayDeque, especially the efficient handling of the circular array logic and resizing.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The manipulation of the front and rear pointers when adding/removing elements felt a bit clunky. I could have used helper methods to make the code more readable.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I learned how to implement a more efficient resize() method that minimizes unnecessary resizing and avoids the overhead of copying data more than necessary.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I had spent more time thinking about edge cases, especially when the deque shrinks. This would have made resizing logic simpler and more reliable.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would spend more time on refactoring my resize() method and implement more helper methods to reduce redundancy.
